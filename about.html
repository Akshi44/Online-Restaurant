            <h1>About Our Restaurant</h1>
            <p>The first restaurant proprietor is believed to have been one A. Boulanger, a soup vendor, who opened his business in Paris in 1765. The sign above his door advertised restoratives, or restaurants, referring to the soups and broths available within. The institution took its name from that sign, and restaurant now denotes a public eating place in English, French, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Romanian, and many other languages, with some variations. For example, in Spanish and Portuguese the word becomes restaurante, in Italian it is ristorante, in Swedish restaurang, in Russian restoran, and in Polish restauracia.Although inns and hostelries often served paying guests meals from the hosts table, or table dhôte, and beverages were sold in cafés, Boulangers restaurant was probably the first public place where any diner might order a meal from a menu offering a choice of dishes.</p>
